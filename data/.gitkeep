# This is the directory where data will be generated and stored when data.py is run.
# Don't delete this directory because then data.py won't know where to generate data.
# If you ever accidentally delete this directory, just make a new one named data.
# If you want to change the name of the directory where data is stored from data to
# something else or generate data in a different directory, you will need to go to
# __init_.py in the utils folder in the folder data_code and change the variable
# datdir to reflect the name of the directory where you want to generate data.
